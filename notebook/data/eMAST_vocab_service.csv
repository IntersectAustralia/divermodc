Monthly solar radiation regulates rates of plant growth. Modelled by expressing observed monthly solar radiation as normalised anomalies with respect to a standard Angstrom equation that expresses monthly solar radiation in terms of astonomically determined parameters and relative sunshine duration, as described in Hutchinson et al. (1984). The monthly anomalies were interpolated by trivariate thin plate smoothing spline functions of longitude, latitude and the proportion of wet days in the month using ANUSPLIN Version 4.5. This anomaly method provided a more direct, and more statistically robust, representation of the impact of precipitation on solar radiation than the method described in Hutchinson et al. (1984). The proportion of wet days, as provided by  eMAST_ANUClimate_mon_pwet_v1m0_1970_2012, acted as simple surrogate for relative sunshine duration.
