Temperature,air_temperture,air_temperture,,,,2 m instantaneous air temperature,"Temperature = A measure of the average kinetic energy of the individual atoms or molecules composing a substance, a quantity measured by a thermometer, specifically with reference to a scale based on defined fiducial points - usually of a water substance, to include the ice and steam points. Surface-temperature = The temperature of the ambient air near the surface of the earth, almost invariably determined by a thermometer in an instrument shelter.","Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature.",,,"daily, monthly, annual, WATCH, maximum, minimum, mean, average, eWATCH"

Precipitation,convective_precipitation_flux,convective_precipitation_flux,,,,"Rainfall rate, bias corrected with CRU TS3.101 data (TS3.21 for 2010-2012) and gauge “catch corrected” (average over previous 3 hrs).","Rainfall = The amount of precipitation of any type; usually taken as that amount measured by means of a rain gauge (thus, a small, varying amount of direct condensation in the form of dew is included). Precipitation = (1) Any or all of the forms of water particles, whether liquid or solid, that fall from clouds and reach the ground. It is a major class of hydrometeor but is distinguised from cloud, fog, dew, rime, frost etc., in that it must ""fall""; and is distinguished from cloud and vigra in that it must reach the ground. Precipitation includes liquid precipitation (rain, drizzle), freezing precipitation (freezing drizzle, freezing rain), and frozen precipitation (snow pellets, snow grains, ice crystals, ice pellets, hail). (2) The amount, usually expressed in units of liquid water depth (e.g., inches), of the water substance that has fallen on a horizontal surface at a given point over a specified time interval. As this is usually measured in a fixed rain gauge, small amount of dew, frost, rime etc., may be included in the total.","In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, ""flux"" implies per unit area, called ""flux density"" in physics.",,,
Snowfall,convective_snowfall_flux,convective_snowfall_flux,,,,"Snowfall rate, bias corrected with CRU TS3.101 data (TS3.21 for 2010-2012) and gauge “catch corrected” (average over previous 3 hrs).","Snow = a type of frozen precipitation composed of white or translucent ice cystals, chiefly in complex branch hexagonal form and often agglomerated into snowflakes, especially at temperatures warmer than -5°C.","In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, ""flux"" implies per unit area, called ""flux density"" in physics.",,,
surface incident shortwave radiation,surface_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air,surface_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air,,,,Short-wave downwards surface radiation flux (average over previous 3 hours),Atmospheric radiation = Infrared radiation (energy in the wavelenght interval of 3-80 micrograms) emitted by or being propagated through the atmosphere; contains both upwelling and downwelling components.,"The surface called ""surface"" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. ""shortwave"" means shortwave radiation. Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean ""net downward"". Surface downwelling shortwave is the sum of direct and diffuse solar radiation incident on the surface, and is sometimes called ""global radiation"". When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called ""irradiance"". In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called ""vector irradiance"". In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, ""flux"" implies per unit area, called ""flux density"" in physics.",,,
